(this is basically my first upload to github so im not sure if im doing this right)

## Adds a few tools to help clean up the current level after completely destroying it.
Currently, there are only 2 main features, but more will be added later.

(I just realized that SoulWithMae already made a scene cleanup tool. I am typing this after I already made the entire mod. I DIDNT KNOW ONE ALREADY EXISTED!!!!)


<b>Before going over the features, you should know that this mod supports Fusion and is recommended for use with this.

By default, the mod will try to use Fusion methods of despawning objects, however, this can be changed on its BoneMenu page to use a method that doesn't require Fusion. (Fusion is not listed as a dependency because of this.)

(also objects may not despawn or respawn that are in other zones, I have no idea how to fix that)</b>


## Crate Management
When you accidentally (or purposely) demolish a room, you may be disappointed there's no way to respawn the starting props without reloading the level. However, with this feature, you can do 3 main things.

#

### Despawn all Props
This is just a generic despawn all props button. The only purpose of this is for people who do not have Fusion and have no other way of despawning every prop quickly.

<b>(NOTICE: The non-Fusion despawning method can sometimes despawn things that should NEVER be despawned. This mostly happens on base game levels, so if you are on a modded level, you should most likely be fine.</b>

#

### Clear & Restore Old Props
This button will despawn all props in the level, but will also respawn all the props that spawn in when loading the level!
Basically the same as reloading the level but in a second.

#

### Spawn all Props
Like the despawn all props button, this doesn't have as many uses, as it just spawns the props that spawn in when loading the level <b>WITHOUT</b> clearing every old item.

useful for like two scenarios but oh well

## NPC Cleanup
This feature allows you to despawn all active NPCs, or despawn a specific type of (base game) NPC.
